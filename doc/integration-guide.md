# RaffleCast Raffle Creation Implementation Guide

This guide outlines how to implement the improved raffle creation workflow in your RaffleCast application.

## Files to Update

1. **Replace `CreateRafflePage.jsx`** with the new implementation
2. **Add new CSS** to support the enhanced form UI

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Replace CreateRafflePage.jsx

Replace your existing `CreateRafflePage.jsx` with the improved version that includes:
- Multi-step form interface
- Better validation
- Improved user experience

### Step 2: Add CSS

Add the new CSS to your project. You have two options:

**Option 1:** Add as a separate file
- Create a new file `raffle-form.css` in your styles directory
- Import it in your CreateRafflePage component:
  ```javascript
  import '../styles/raffle-form.css';
  ```

**Option 2:** Merge with existing CSS
- Copy the CSS styles into your existing `pages.css` file

### Step 3: Test the Implementation

After implementing the changes, test the raffle creation flow:

1. Ensure you can navigate to the raffle creation page
2. Test form validation for all fields
3. Verify the multi-step navigation works correctly
4. Confirm the raffle is created successfully and stored in the database
5. Check that you're redirected to the manage raffles page after creation

## Key Improvements

### Enhanced User Experience
- Step-by-step form reduces cognitive load
- Clear validation feedback
- Better organized form fields

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed validation logic for dates
- Better error handling
- More relaxed cast hash validation to support various formats

### Future Enhancements

Consider these future improvements:
1. **Raffle Preview:** Add a preview step before submission
2. **Draft Saving:** Allow users to save drafts of raffles
3. **Template Support:** Create and use raffle templates
4. **Image Upload:** Support for adding images to raffles

## Design Notes

The design follows your existing style guidelines:
- Uses your color variables
- Maintains consistent spacing
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
