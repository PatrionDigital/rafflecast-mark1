Implementation Plan: Raffle Success Page for Zora Integration
Based on my review of the uploaded files, I can see that the new raffle creation workflow with Zora Coins integration is nearly complete. The key missing component is a proper success page that displays after raffle creation. Let me outline a detailed plan to address this need.
Current Status Assessment

The raffle creation process is working with the four-step workflow:

Basic Info (Title, Description)
Time Settings (Closing Date, Challenge Period)
Ticket Creation (Zora Coin setup)
Review and Submit

The form submission in CreateRafflePage.jsx attempts to navigate to /creator/dashboard after successful raffle creation, but this route doesn't exist.
There's no proper success feedback or confirmation page after creating a raffle.

Implementation Plan
Step 1: Create RaffleSuccessPage Component
File to create: src/pages/RaffleSuccessPage.jsx
This component will:

Accept a raffle ID via URL parameters
Fetch and display raffle details
Show a success message and next steps
Include navigation options to manage raffles or create another raffle

Details:

Use Windmill UI components for consistency
Include proper loading and error states
Display raffle details including ticket token information

Step 2: Add Route to Router Configuration
File to modify: src/app/router.jsx
Add a new route for the success page:
{
path: "/creator/raffles/success/:raffleId",
element: <RaffleSuccessPage />,
errorElement: <ErrorBoundary />
}
Also add:

Import statement for RaffleSuccessPage
Ensure this route is properly nested under the creator layout

Step 3: Update Redirect Logic in CreateRafflePage
File to modify: src/pages/CreateRafflePage.jsx
Modify the handleCreateRaffle function to:

Store the created raffle ID
Implement proper redirection to the success page using the raffle ID
Fix the inconsistency in response handling (the function currently expects a structure that doesn't match what addRaffle returns)

Step 4: Enhance RaffleContext for Better Data Access
File to modify: src/context/RaffleContext.jsx
Verify and improve the addRaffle function to:

Return a consistent response structure with the raffle ID
Handle the new raffle data format (with ticketToken and prize fields)
Implement proper parsing of the JSON fields

Step 5: Ensure Database Functions Support New Fields
File to modify: src/utils/tursoUtils.jsx
Verify and update addRaffleToDB and fetchRaffleById to:

Properly handle the ticketToken and prize JSON fields
Return appropriate success/error responses
Parse JSON fields when fetching raffle data

Detailed Implementation Specifications

1. RaffleSuccessPage.jsx
   Component Structure:

Card layout with success message at the top
Display raffle title, description, and closing date
Show ticket token information (name, symbol, contract address)
Include prize distribution summary
Provide navigation buttons: "Manage Your Raffles" and "Create Another Raffle"
Include loading and error states

Technical Requirements:

Use the useParams hook to get the raffle ID from the URL
Use the useRaffle hook to fetch raffle data
Implement proper JSON parsing for ticket token and prize data
Apply consistent Windmill UI styling

2. Router Configuration
   Route Addition:

Add route path /creator/raffles/success/:raffleId
Ensure it's accessible via the creator layout
Include appropriate error boundary

Navigation Flow:

From raffle creation → success page → management or new raffle

3. CreateRafflePage.jsx Updates
   Changes to handleCreateRaffle:

Ensure proper response handling from addRaffle
Update redirection logic to navigate to /creator/raffles/success/${raffleId}
Fix success message text to be more descriptive

Code Modifications:

Simplify JSON handling for ticketToken and prize
Ensure consistent response structure
Add proper error handling for edge cases

4. RaffleContext.jsx Enhancements
   Changes to addRaffle:

Return a consistent response structure: { success: boolean, id: string, error?: string }
Ensure ticketToken and prize are properly stringified before storing
Add parsing logic for JSON fields when retrieving raffle data

Other Improvements:

Add a dedicated method to get a raffle by ID with all fields parsed
Implement proper error handling
Ensure consistent data structure

5. Database Integration
   Updates to tursoUtils.jsx:

Verify SQL schema is ready for new fields
Update addRaffleToDB function to handle new fields
Ensure fetchRaffleById properly parses JSON fields
Return consistent response structures

Testing Checklist
Before implementing, we should verify:

The database schema has columns for ticketToken and prize
The flow from creation to redirection is working
The raffle ID is properly passed between components
JSON serialization/deserialization works correctly
